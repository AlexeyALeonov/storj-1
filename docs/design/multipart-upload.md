# Multipart Upload

## Abstract

This design document describes what problems multipart upload solves and how it can be implemented. Currently there is no direct support for multipart upload on the Satellite side. The feature is simulated completely on the gateway side, which requires keeping a lot of data in memory and doesn't achieve the full usefulness of metainfo upload.
