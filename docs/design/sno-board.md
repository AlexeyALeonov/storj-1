# SNOBoard

## OVERVIEW

The SNOBoard is a GUI for Storage Node Operators to get more information about their storage nodes performance as it pertains to the network or individual satellites.

## GOALS

- Give SNOs a pretty graphical user interface they can look at to get metrics on:
	- Node(s) performance per satellite
	- Storage space
  	- Bandwidth
	- Audit information
	- Uptime information
  	- Current Status
	- SN version currently running
	- DQ’ed status
	- Containment status
- Satellite notifications
	- Notifications center on the SNOBoard
	- Email notification opt-in
- Expected payout per satellite, per node
- Give SNOs a GUI to configure their SNs
	- Ability to adjust allocated egress/ storage space in the GUI
	- Ability to graceful exit a satellite or the network in the GUI

## Business Requirements/ Job Stories

- When a SNO starts the CLI dashboard I want the URL for the SNOBoard to be printed on the screen so that the user can easily access the SNOBoard.
- When my SN is connected to multiple satellites I want the ability to select a satellite on the SNOBoard so that I can drill down into information about my node as it pertains to that satellite.
	- All satellites should be the default option
		- This option should NOT show information about uptime or audit checks because those are specific to satellites
		- The “All Satellites” option should only show information about allocated and used storage space/ bandwidth 
- When I want to know how much of the allocated storage space my SN has used on the network I want a simple graphic on the SNOBoard so that I can consume this information quickly
- When I need to know how much of the allocated bandwidth my SN has used I want a simple graphic on the SNOBoard so that I can consume this information quickly
- When I am looking at the bandwidth graphic I want to be able to distinguish how much bandwidth has been egress vs ingress so that I can determine if my internet plan is suitable for the type of traffic my node is getting. 
- When a SNO is running an outdated version of SN software I want that information to be displayed on the SNOBoard so that they SNO can determine if they need to upgrade their software
- When I need to know what wallet address my SN is configured with I want that information to be on the SNOBoard so that I can figure out what wallet I should be expecting my payout on
- When a SNO starts the SNOBoard I want a set of links on the interface they can reference to get connected to the community or get more information about running their SN
	- Include a link to the community 
	- Include a link to the support portal
	- Include a link to the SNO documentation
	- Include a link to the Aha Ideas portal

## DESIGN OVERVIEW

- Use an open source graph library for the SNOBoard so that we can use the same graph library on the Satellite GUI so that our UX/UI is similar across our product.
